        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>School Safety Programmes (SSP) are essential to ensure the safety of students, staff, and faculty during a disaster. These programmes include evacuation drills, emergency response plans, and communication systems.</p>
        <h2>Evacuation Drills</h2>
        <p>Evacuation drills are an essential part of SSP. They help students and staff become familiar with the evacuation routes and procedures. It is important to conduct regular drills to ensure everyone knows what to do in case of an emergency.</p>
        <h2>Emergency Response Plans</h2>
        <p>Emergency response plans provide detailed instructions on how to respond to different types of emergencies, such as fires, earthquakes, and active shooter situations. It is important to regularly review and update these plans to ensure they are effective and up-to-date.</p>
        <h2>Communication Systems</h2>
        <p>Effective communication is critical during a disaster. SSP should include communication systems that allow for quick and efficient communication between school personnel, first responders, and students' families.</p>
