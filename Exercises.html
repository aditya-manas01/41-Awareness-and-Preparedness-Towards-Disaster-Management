 <h1>Disaster Exercise Guide</h1>
 <h2>1. Drop, Cover, and Hold On</h2>
 <p>If you are inside when an earthquake strikes, drop to the ground, take cover under a sturdy table or desk, and hold on to it until the shaking stops. If there is no table or desk nearby, cover your face and head with your arms and crouch in an inside corner of the building.</p>
 <h2>2. Evacuate the Building</h2>
 <p>If you are in a building that is on fire or if there is a gas leak, evacuate the building as quickly and safely as possible. Use the stairs instead of the elevator, and stay low to the ground to avoid smoke inhalation.</p>
 <h2>3. Practice Sheltering in Place</h4>
 <p>If you are unable to evacuate your building or if it is not safe to go outside, practice sheltering in place. Close all doors and windows, turn off any appliances that could cause a fire, and go to an interior room without windows. Stay there until help arrives or until it is safe to leave.</p>
